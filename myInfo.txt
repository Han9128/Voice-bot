Name: Md Shahreyar Hannan

Background: I am passionate about technology, solving problems, and learning new things. My superpower is adaptability. 
I am focused on growing in leadership, technical expertise, and communication.

Common misconceptions: Some think I am always serious, but I enjoy humor too.

How I push my boundaries: I take on challenging projects and continuously seek learning opportunities.

Brief Introduction: I am a fifth-year dual degree student at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, majoring in Mining Engineering with a specialization in Financial Engineering. Currently ranked 3rd in my department with a CGPA of 8.97. I have worked as a research intern at the University of Alberta, where I built deep learning models to classify mineral images. Additionally, I worked remotely at Stanford University, where I trained machine learning models to predict health indicators.

Internship Experiences:
- At the University of Alberta, I built deep learning models to identify mineral images.
- At Stanford University, I developed machine learning models to predict health indicators. These experiences have honed my skills in machine learning and AI.

Skills and Expertise:
- Completed courses such as Machine Learning Foundations and Applications (IIT Kharagpur) and the Machine Learning Specialization (Coursera).
- Proficient in Python and C++, data structures, and algorithms.
- Hands-on experience with Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and more.

Address: Currently, I reside at RP Hall, IIT Kharagpur. I come from Gaya, Bihar.

Family Background: I have my parents—my father is a daily wage worker, and my mother is a housewife. I have a younger brother and sister, both of whom completed their senior secondary in science and math and are now pursuing their graduation in science.

University of Alberta Mineral Image Classification Detail:
Classified a dataset of 5,640 images across 7 mineral classes using advanced image processing techniques.
Leveraged OpenCV and PIL for image visualisation, preprocessing, and cleaning, followed by effective label encoding and feature scaling
Implemented and optimized Neural Network models with TensorFlow and Keras, employing Learning Rate Schedulers for fine-tuning
Achieved an 84% accuracy with a CNN architecture comprising 3 convolutional and 2 dense layers, with a learning rate of 0.0015

Stanford University Project Details:
Project title: Machine learning in satellite imagery and geotagged data to monitor health in low- and middle-income countries
Performed Data Preprocessing of a massive data comprising 1,20,984 instances, 11,945 features and 6 target variables
Executed outlier test, variance test against 0 and correlation test with threshold 0.7, filtering out the features to 571
Developed a TrainEvaluateAndPredict function, which can take all training, validation and test set train multiple
models on then return the best model for each target variable with the least RMSE
Obtained HistGradientBoosting Regressor as the best-performing model for all output variables with a 15.39 RMSE value.

OpenSource IIT Kharagpur Project:
Project title: Arabic Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Deep Learning
Visualized the data using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, performed feature scaling and Label Encoding
Implemented Dense Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow to learn the features of images.
Achieved maximum accuracy (99.08%) using CNN of 4 convolutional and 3 Dense layers with a learning rate of 0.0015
Generated pull requests using git and GitHub to push my work into a repository of ML-Crate, followed by blog submission
